Project Steps

Phase 1:Project Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition: The project involves using IBM Cognos to analyze sales data and extract insights about top selling products, peak sales periods, and customer preferences. The objective is to help businesses improve inventory management and marketing strategies by understanding sales trends and customer behavior. This project includes defining analysis objectives, collecting sales data, designing relevant visualizations in IBM Cognos, and deriving actionable insights.

Design Thinking:

Analysis Objectives: Define the specific insights you want to extract from the sale data, such as identifying top-selling products, analyzing sales trends, and understanding customer preferences.
Data Collection: Determine the sources and methods for collecting sales data, including transaction records, product information, and customer demographics.
Visualization Strategy: Plan how to visualize the insights using IBM Cognos to create interactive dashboards and reports.
Actionable Insights: Identify how the derived insights can guide inventory management and marketing strategies.
Phase 2: Innovation

Consider incorporating machine learning algorithms to predict future sales trends or customer behaviors.
